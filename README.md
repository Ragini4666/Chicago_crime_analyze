## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
     The growing complexity of crime data challenges law enforcement in identifying patterns,
     high-rish areas and trends.  Limited insights hinder resoource allocation, crime prediction, 
     and safety measures. This Project seeks to analyze crime data to provide 
     actionable insights for effective prevention and community safety.

## BUSINESS USE CASES:
1.Crime Hotsport Identification

2.Trend and Seasonality analysis

3.Arrest Efficiency Analysis

4.Neighborhood Safety Assessment

5.Crime Prediction and Prevention , etc..

## APPROACH:
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
    Use Python to clean the data by handling missing values, formatting the categorical data to standardize.
    Use power BI to format the dates and times.
    Import the cleaned dataset into Power BI for future analysis and create a interacctive dashbord.
### ANALYSIS WITH POWER BI
     Examine crime patterns over time to uncover seasonal variations and long-terms trends for proactive planning.
     Evaluate the effectiveness of arrests in addressing various crime types, providing insights into law enforcements outcomes.
     Assess safety levels across neighborhoods to identify areas and enhance community well-being.
     
## FINAL REPORT:
     The final report aims to analyse crime data comprehensively, providing the government with critical insights into crime-prone aresa, including their locations and crime rates. The report will also present detailed crime case information categorized by year, month, day, and area, to enabling better understanding and decision-making. Additionally, it will hightlight safer neighborhoods, allowing people to make informed choices for a secure and peaceful living environment.
